# Spot_checking_algorithm

A Simple approach to check the best models according to the the given data.
Spot-checking is intended to evaluate a diverse set of algorithms rapidly and provide a rough first-cut result.

# Importance of Spot-Checking:

Spot-checking is an approach to help overcome the “hard problem” of applied machine learning and encourage you to clearly think about the higher-order search problem being performed in any machine learning project.

It involves rapidly testing a large suite of diverse machine learning algorithms on a problem in order to quickly discover what algorithms might work and where to focus attention.

# Advanatge of Spot Checking:

## It is fast ## it by-passes the days or weeks of preparation and analysis and playing with algorithms that may not ever lead to a result.

## It is objective ##, allowing you to discover what might work well for a problem rather than going with what you used last time.

## It gets results ##; you will actually fit models, make predictions and know if your problem can be predicted and what baseline skill may look like.

# SPOT-CHECKING FRAMEWORK IN PYTHON:

# 1.LOAD DATASETS
# 2.DEFINE MODELS
# 3.EVALUATE MODELS
# 4.SUMMARIZE RESULT
